    <p>Welcome to my personal page!</p>
    
    <p>
    I'm a social researcher and data visualizer, combining knowledge from social and computer sciences.
    After my degree in sociology I mainly worked in the field of educational research.
    At the moment I'm in a master's degree program called "Computing in the Humanities" at the University of Bamberg.
    For more information about my education and my professional background, please have a look at my <a href="cv_en.html">CV</a>.

    <p>
    Lately, I've been developing data stories, which includes data analysis and interpretation as well as data visualisation and storytelling.
    You can find my projects <a href="projects.html">here</a>.
